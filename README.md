Visulaization of the rie of Covid-19 cases in India along with comparison of the following traditional trend estimation methods:
1. M-Moving Average Method
2. Exponential Smoothing
3. Curve Fitting

1. M - Moving Average

3. Curve Fitting: Quadratic polynomial is best fitted for the data

Conclusion: We know that RMSE is the measure of how accurately the model predicts the response and it is the most important criterion for fit if the main purpose of the model is prediction. However, the best measure of model fit depends on researcherâ€™s objective. For my data, after calculation of RMSE values from three different methods we can conclude that M-moving average method is the best suited model for this data since it has the lowest error value.
